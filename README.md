## Project Title
Database Project - TakeAway System

## Introduction:
This section provides the basic information about the system being developed. The document aims at providing system’s introduction to the customer. Different subsequent sections including Purpose, Objectives, Scope and Significance elaborately introduce and define the system.


## Purpose/ Problem Statement:
Before the client (Bonne’ Nourriture) came to us for a solution for their food restaurant, it was facing several problems. Some of these are as follows:
1. There was a lot of paper work included that itself was troublesome.
2. It was difficult to take orders and they eventually had very small member-ships.
3. Orders management was very poor. Causing wrong orders to be placed.
4. It was difficult to manage records, produce reports etc.
5. There was no track of customers.
6. Overall management was based on paper. No automation.


## Scope:
The scope of the project includes all the general and specific objectives set for the system. The basic aim still remains the main goal i.e. to simplify and improve the quality of ordering process.


## Significnce:
The system aims at providing the best solution to the problem statement. In particular the system will benefit the following:
1. Help customers and employees in order placement and processing.
2. Help eradicate the paper management and automate maximum operations.
3. Provide an online and secure ordering option to the customers.
4. The system will automate all the major operations involved in food ordering.
